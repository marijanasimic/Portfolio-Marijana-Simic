        <p>
          I am interesting in IT and everything in its orbit. I recently began
          to be fascinated by web programming, developing apps and building
          websites.
        </p>
        <br />
        <p>
          I have been doing the same, routine job for a long time and without
          the possibility of further professional development and advancement.
          The research spirit and openness to new experiences and the desire to
          gain new knowledge, especially about IT, led me to start learning on
          my own. I used various online courses and tutorials in my learning,
          and below are some projects I have build.

              can check the balance on the bank account, transfer money to
              another user’s account, loan money and delete account. All
              transactions in application can be done in 2 min, and the date of
              each transaction is recorded. Here I fetch a JSON file across the
              network and in the end of the process get the country data needed
              for the application (flag, country name and region). <br /><br />

              refreshes their browser. A slider was used to display the
              testimonials of users of the site's services. <br />
